| Functions for SCALARs or strings  | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [chomp](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/chomp)| This safer version of chop removes any trailing string that corresponds to the current value of $/ . It returns the total number of characters removed from all its arguments. 
| chop |   |
| chr |   |
| crypt |   |
| fc |   |
| hex |   |
| index |   |
| lc |   |
| lcfirst |   |
| length |   |
| oct |   |
| ord |   |
| pack |   |
| q// |   |
| qq// |   |
| reverse |   |
| rindex |   |
| sprintf |   |
| substr |   |
| tr/// |   |
| uc |   |
| ucfirst |   |
| y/// |   |

fc is available only if the "fc" feature is enabled or if it is prefixed with CORE::. The "fc" feature is enabled automatically with a use v5.16 (or higher) declaration in the current scope.

Regular expressions and pattern matching
m//, pos, qr//, quotemeta, s///, split, study

Numeric functions
abs, atan2, cos, exp, hex, int, log, oct, rand, sin, sqrt, srand

Functions for real @ARRAYs
each, keys, pop, push, shift, splice, unshift, values

Functions for list data
grep, join, map, qw//, reverse, sort, unpack

Functions for real %HASHes
delete, each, exists, keys, values

Input and output functions
binmode, close, closedir, dbmclose, dbmopen, die, eof, fileno, flock, format, getc, print, printf, read, readdir, readline, rewinddir, say, seek, seekdir, select, syscall, sysread, sysseek, syswrite, tell, telldir, truncate, warn, write

say is available only if the "say" feature is enabled or if it is prefixed with CORE::. The "say" feature is enabled automatically with a use v5.10 (or higher) declaration in the current scope.

Functions for fixed-length data or records
pack, read, syscall, sysread, sysseek, syswrite, unpack, vec

Functions for filehandles, files, or directories
-X, chdir, chmod, chown, chroot, fcntl, glob, ioctl, link, lstat, mkdir, open, opendir, readlink, rename, rmdir, select, stat, symlink, sysopen, umask, unlink, utime

Keywords related to the control flow of your Perl program
break, caller, continue, die, do, dump, eval, evalbytes, exit, __FILE__, goto, last, __LINE__, next, __PACKAGE__, redo, return, sub, __SUB__, wantarray

break is available only if you enable the experimental "switch" feature or use the CORE:: prefix. The "switch" feature also enables the default, given and when statements, which are documented in "Switch Statements" in perlsyn. The "switch" feature is enabled automatically with a use v5.10 (or higher) declaration in the current scope. In Perl v5.14 and earlier, continue required the "switch" feature, like the other keywords.

evalbytes is only available with the "evalbytes" feature (see feature) or if prefixed with CORE::. __SUB__ is only available with the "current_sub" feature or if prefixed with CORE::. Both the "evalbytes" and "current_sub" features are enabled automatically with a use v5.16 (or higher) declaration in the current scope.

Keywords related to scoping
caller, import, local, my, our, package, state, use

state is available only if the "state" feature is enabled or if it is prefixed with CORE::. The "state" feature is enabled automatically with a use v5.10 (or higher) declaration in the current scope.

Miscellaneous functions
defined, formline, lock, prototype, reset, scalar, undef

Functions for processes and process groups
alarm, exec, fork, getpgrp, getppid, getpriority, kill, pipe, qx//, readpipe, setpgrp, setpriority, sleep, system, times, wait, waitpid

Keywords related to Perl modules
do, import, no, package, require, use

Keywords related to classes and object-orientation
bless, dbmclose, dbmopen, package, ref, tie, tied, untie, use

Low-level socket functions
accept, bind, connect, getpeername, getsockname, getsockopt, listen, recv, send, setsockopt, shutdown, socket, socketpair

System V interprocess communication functions
msgctl, msgget, msgrcv, msgsnd, semctl, semget, semop, shmctl, shmget, shmread, shmwrite

Fetching user and group info
endgrent, endhostent, endnetent, endpwent, getgrent, getgrgid, getgrnam, getlogin, getpwent, getpwnam, getpwuid, setgrent, setpwent

Fetching network info
endprotoent, endservent, gethostbyaddr, gethostbyname, gethostent, getnetbyaddr, getnetbyname, getnetent, getprotobyname, getprotobynumber, getprotoent, getservbyname, getservbyport, getservent, sethostent, setnetent, setprotoent, setservent

Time-related functions
gmtime, localtime, time, times

Non-function keywords
and, AUTOLOAD, BEGIN, CHECK, cmp, CORE, __DATA__, default, DESTROY, else, elseif, elsif, END, __END__, eq, for, foreach, ge, given, gt, if, INIT, le, lt, ne, not, or, UNITCHECK, unless, until, when, while, x, xor
